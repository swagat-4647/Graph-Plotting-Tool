# Graph-Plotting-Tool
##Python project for B.Tech Semester 2

This is a Python based desktop Application, designed for secondary and higher secondary students, for visualizing various plots and conic sections in 2 deimensions as well as in 3 dimension.
The proposed model focuses on visualization of  the geometric diagrams  in 2D  ad 3D dimensions with different colors and coordinates to simplification and clear view about that figure, enhancing the ability students to have a clear conceptual knowledge of geometry, which would help them in their Engineering, BCs. Degrees.
The application is divided into two different section mainly: Mathematical and 3D graphs.

##Mathematical Section
The section is further sub-divided into 6 differenet categories
1. Line graphs: plots all line equations having following format:
  1. slope-intercept form
  2. slope-point form
  3. two-point form
  4. intercept-line equation
2. Circle: plots circle using its general equation
3. Ellipse: plots ellipse using its general equation
4. Hyperbola: plots hyperbola using its genernal equation
5. Parabola: plots parabola using its general equation.
6. Polynomial graphs:  This accepts polynomial equation and thus plots it into 2d and 3d.

All of the Mathematical Equations for plots are implemented refering the relevant mathematical books for higher secondary: R. D. Sharma

## 3D Graphs
This section consists of input section which accepts a multi degree polynomial equation, along with various trignometric and logarithmic entities and plots the same into 3d plotter with different types of 3d colors schemes.
